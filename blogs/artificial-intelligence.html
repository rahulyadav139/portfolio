    <ol>
        <li>The first types of AI are those machines which can react to certain situations, but these machines don’t have any sort of memory and hence cannot learn or use past experience. Computer chess games are a simple example of this first type of AI.</li>
        <li>The second types of AI are those machines which are capable of using past memory to form future ones. An excellent example of this second type of AI is self-driving cars.</li>
        <li>The third type of AI at present only exists in theory, and as per the imagination, it will be able to have humane emotions like beliefs, desires, opinions, intentions, etc.</li>
        <li>The most sophisticated form of AI if ever comes to exist would be this fourth type of AI. This fourth type of AI machine will be able to have a sense of self-awareness, emotions and consciousness. If this type of AI ever comes to exist, then it would be a real revolution.</li>
    </ol>
